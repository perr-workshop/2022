    <h2>5th Workshop on Program Equivalence and Relational Reasoning</h2>
    
    <p>
        PERR is an annual international workshop dedicated to the formal verification of program equivalence and related relational problems. It is the 5th in a series of meetings that bring together researchers from different areas interested in equivalence and related questions. PERR 2022 will be held as a workshop at <a href="https://floc2022.org/">FLOC 2022</a>, as a satellite event to <a href="http://i-cav.org/2022/">CAV 2022</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Program equivalence is arguably one of the most interesting and at the same time important problems in formal verification. It is a cross-cutting topic that has attracted the interest of several research communities: the field of denotational (game) semantics, deductive software verification, bounded model checking, specification inference, software evolution and regression testing, etc.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers of the different fields in touch and to stipulate an exchange of ideas leading to forging a community working on PERR. It welcomes contributions from the topics mentioned above but is also open to new questions regarding program equivalence. This includes related research areas of relational reasoning like program refinement or the verification of hyperproperties, in particular of secure information flow.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> - regression verification </li>
        <li> - program equivalence </li>
        <li> - equivalence of higher order programs </li>
        <li> - product programs, relational calculi </li>
        <li> - verification of hyperproperties </li>
        <li> - program refinement, refinement calculus </li>
        <li> - specification of differences between programs </li>
        <li> - inferring semantic differences between programs </li>
        <li> - transformation validation </li>
        <li> - correct compiler transformations </li>
        <li> - automata bisimulation </li>
        <li> - code equivalence checking in teaching and marking </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        This is an informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tool presentations.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The workshop will have informal proceedings, posted on its webpage, and speakers will be asked to consider submitting papers towards a post-proceedings volume.
